abstract="In this chapter, we give an overview of what ontologies are and how they can be used. We discuss the impact of the expressiveness, the number of domain elements, the community size, the conceptual dynamics, and other variables on the feasibility of an ontology project. Then, we break down the general promise of ontologies of facilitating the exchange and usage of knowledge to six distinct technical advancements that ontologies actually provide, and discuss how this should influence design choices in ontology projects. Finally, we summarize the main challenges of ontology management in real-world applications, and explain which expectations from practitioners can be met as of today.",

  abstract     = {In the last five years, deep learning methods and particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have exhibited excellent accuracies in many pattern classification problems. Most of the state-of-the-art models apply data-augmentation techniques at the training stage. This paper provides a brief tutorial on data preprocessing and shows its benefits by using the competitive MNIST handwritten digits classification problem. We show and analyze the impact of different preprocessing techniques on the performance of three CNNs, LeNet, Network3 and DropConnect, together with their ensembles. The analyzed transformations are, centering, elastic deformation, translation, rotation and different combinations of them. Our analysis demonstrates that data-preprocessing techniques, such as the combination of elastic deformation and rotation, together with ensembles have a high potential to further improve the state-of-the-art accuracy in MNIST classification.},
